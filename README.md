# Hydration is Key ğŸ’§

## Usage
To get started, first navigate the package to your environment, through your established waterway:
```console
user@machine:~$ npm i stay-hydrated
```
Finally, renovate your water piping system to funnel the package to your locale!
```js
const { hydrateMyString } = require('stay-hydrated');
```

## Methods
`hydrateMyString(str: String) => String`

This method takes a string as an argument and replaces all w's with ğŸ’§ and, all instances of the word *'water'* with ğŸ’§ğŸ’§ğŸ’§ğŸ’§ğŸ’§ (*case-insensitive*).

### *Example:* 
```js
const hydratedString = hydrateMyString("What is a waterway?");
console.log(hydratedString);
```

```console
> ğŸ’§hat is a ğŸ’§ğŸ’§ğŸ’§ğŸ’§ğŸ’§ğŸ’§ay?
```
